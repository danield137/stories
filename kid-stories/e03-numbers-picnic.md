  The picnic blanket was soft and full.
Juice boxes, snacks, and folded napkins.
“Go play,” someone said. “We’re right here.”

  Four kids ran toward the trees.
The sun was high.
“I’ll count first!” said Sana.

  “One apple in that tree,” she said.
It was small, red, and round.
“I see it!” said Max.

  “Two flowers!” said Max.
He pointed to yellow ones near a log.
“They smell nice,” said Niko.

  “Three dogs over there!”
Zoe pointed to the park trail.
Two were chasing a stick. One just watched.

  They laughed and walked through tall grass.
“Four clouds,” said Niko.
“Big and puffy like mashed potatoes.”

  “Five bees,” whispered Sana.
They hovered around a bush.
“Let’s give them space,” Max said.

  “Six round rocks,” said Zoe.
They were warm in the sun.
“They look like little eggs.”

  They wandered near a quiet tree.
“Seven birds!” shouted Max.
“Wait—now they flew away!”

“Eight red leaves,” said Niko.
She held one up.
“This one has spots.”

“Nine ants,” said Sana.
They watched them carry something small.
“Are they having their own picnic?” Zoe asked.

Page 12
They all laughed.
"I'm tired," said Niko.
"My legs are out of numbers."

They ran back to the blanket.
The parents were smiling.
"We found so many things!" Max said.

"Tell us about your adventure," said Mom.
"I liked the puffy clouds," said Niko.
"And the bees were so busy," whispered Sana.

Page 15
"The ants were having their own tiny picnic," said Zoe.
"Just like us!"
Everyone laughed.

"You four are wonderful explorers," said Dad.
He held out a bowl of fresh pineapple.
"This is for our adventurers."

They sat together on the soft blanket.
The pineapple was cold and sweet.
"Tomorrow can we count again?" asked Max.
