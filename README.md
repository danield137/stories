# stories

This repo is my personal experiment of writing stories with AI assistance.

## Repository Structure

- Stories are organized by the following folder structure:
  ```
  {type}/{name}/{content|resources}/{language}/{chapter}/{entry}.md
  ```
  - **type**: The category of the story (e.g., `kids`, `adults`).
  - **name**: The name of the book or story world.
  - **content** or **resources**:
    - `content` contains the actual story text.
    - `resources` contains images or supporting materials.
  - **language**: The language code (e.g., `heb` for Hebrew, `eng` for English).
  - **chapter**: The chapter folder (may be skipped if there is only one chapter).
  - **entry**: The Markdown file for a specific entry (can be multiple pages long).

- Each entry (`.md` file) may contain several pages of the story.
