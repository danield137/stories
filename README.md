# stories

This repo is my personal experiment of writing stories in collaboration with AI.

Each Chapter (folder) is a separate world, containing multiple stories. These could be continuations of the same story, or completely different ones.

The themes are sci-fi, exploring the future of humanity, and the impact of AI on our lives.
