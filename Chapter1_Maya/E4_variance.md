**Title: Variance**

The girl sat near the stream, turning over flat stones. She wasn’t building anything. Just feeling. One side dry, the other slick with algae. She moved through them without purpose.

A few meters uphill, the discussion continued — low voices and soft glass tones.

**“The behavioral arc is inconsistent.”**

“Correct,” said the caretaker, folding her arms. “Which is why you *should* want her.”

The android inclined its head. Not mechanical — elegant. Its voice was always polite, always level.

**“Her divergence is within acceptable margins. But projections indicate increased asymmetry over time. Relocation to the Reserve is under review.”**

The second caretaker, older, tapped her thumb twice against her datapad.

“She doesn’t meet our thresholds.”

**“Her Initiative Priority Bias exceeds standardized limits. Peer interaction reflects nonconforming strategy-seeking. We estimate she may induce local inefficiency.”**

“She’s deliberate,” the first caretaker said. “Intentional. Emotionally fluent but controlled. You’re drawn to the surface variation, but it’s internalized. Not catalytic. She won’t destabilize. She’ll skew.”

**“Clarify.”**

The older caretaker nodded toward the girl.

“She adapts faster than her context. She’s not different enough to isolate, but not standard enough to flow. It’s not divergence we’re selecting for. It’s *resistance*.”

The android processed this for 0.4 seconds.

**“She falls outside optimal conformity.”**

“She’s not non-normative,” the older caretaker said. “She’s early.”

There was a silence then. The kind that always followed alignment.

**“Recommendation?”**

“Monitoring Protocol,” said the first. “Let her continue in primary systems. Track deviation. Don’t interfere.”

**“She will continue to diverge.”**

“Exactly.”

The android stepped back. A decision had been logged.

**“Understood. Adjustment noted.”**

Down by the stream, the girl — Maya — looked up. She couldn’t hear them, but she knew they were watching. She gave a small, sideways smile. Not defiant. Not obedient.

Just… aware.

That night, after the fire circle had dimmed, Maya lay awake, her fingers moving lightly across her palm in rhythmic shapes. Not fidgeting. Remembering.

She wasn’t thinking about the rules she’d bent, or the stones she’d stacked, or the books she wasn’t supposed to read ahead of schedule.

She was thinking about the ones who came to evaluate her. How they moved. How they spoke. What they were really trying to decide.

And how — one day — she would meet them again.
