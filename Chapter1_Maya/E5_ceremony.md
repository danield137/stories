Title: The Ceremony

The dish came in two parts.

First, the bowl — shallow, wide-rimmed, clay-fired. It arrived empty, but warm.

Then, the ladle — not metal, but carved wood, passed from the pot to the bowl in a single, continuous arc. No pause. No flourish. Just a smooth, practiced motion that looked like a memory being repeated.

Maya watched as the chef finished the pour. He didn’t look up, didn’t say a word. But she knew he knew she was watching.

It was always like this here. The same motion. The same silence. A performance so understated, it felt like belief.

She took her seat at the bar.

“You’re not from the valley,” said the man beside her, not looking over.

Maya smiled faintly. “You say that like it’s a secret.”

He shrugged. “It’s the shoes.”

She glanced down. Polished. Gray. Still cleaner than anything should be in this place.

He tapped the bar. “First time?”

“Third.”

He nodded. “Then you know how it works.”

She did. Every night, one story. Always by the fire. Never the same, and never explained.

The old woman’s voice was rough but steady as she began. Something about a man who waited by a bridge that never reached the other side. The story meandered, like it was in no hurry to end.

No one clapped. No one commented. That wasn’t the point.

Maya finished her bowl slowly. The aftertaste was smoky. A little bitter. She liked it. It stayed with her.

She and the man left the bar together, walking the ridge trail in near silence. The sun had already dipped, and the sky was the kind of blue that made everything look like memory.

Across the field, a school group passed in perfect formation — children, small and even-paced, led by an android. Their postures were aligned. Their faces unreadable.

The man slowed, watching them as they moved.

Then, softly:
“How does it feel… looking at them from the outside?”

Maya didn’t answer right away. Her eyes stayed on the line of children as they crossed the field — as she once had.

Then:
“It feels… necessary.”

She kept walking.

The field stayed quiet long after she was gone.
