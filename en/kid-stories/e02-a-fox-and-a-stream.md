  Mira and Leo walked through the field.
The sun was warm on their faces.
They didn’t say much at first.

Page 2
  The grass brushed their legs as they ran.
Birds chirped somewhere high above.
“I think this is the best path,” Leo said.

Page 3
  They reached a small stream.
The water moved gently between rocks.
Mira dipped her foot in. “The water’s cold!”

Page 4
  Leo laughed. “You jumped like a frog!”
Mira splashed him with her toe.
“Now you’re cold too.”

Page 5
  They sat by the stream.
Little fish swam past, quick and quiet.
“Look,” Mira whispered, “that one’s silver.”

Page 6
  A bird flew low over the water.
Its wings made no sound.
“It went that way,” Leo pointed.

Page 7
  The air grew still.
Even the leaves stopped moving.
“Why did it get so quiet?” Mira asked.

Page 8
  Leo stood up slowly.
Something moved on the hill.
“What is that in the bushes?” he said.

Page 9
  A fox stepped into the light.
Its fur was red and brown, almost glowing.
Mira held her breath.

“It’s not scared,” Leo whispered.
The fox looked at them, calm and still.
“He’s just watching.”

Page 11
Mira leaned closer. “He’s beautiful.”
The fox blinked once.
His ears twitched, but he didn’t move.

Then he turned away.
His tail swayed as he walked.
“Goodbye,” Leo said softly.

Page 13
They watched until the fox was gone.
The trees closed behind him.
“I wanted him to stay,” Mira said.

Page 14
They sat again by the stream.
The sun warmed their backs.
No one talked for a while.

On the walk home, they didn’t run.
Their shoes made soft sounds in the dirt.
“I’m glad we saw him,” Leo said.
