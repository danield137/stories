**Title: Standard Inheritance**

The chamber breathed in rhythm. A soft pulse of light. White. Then blue.

Suspended in the fluid beyond the glass, the child floated — eyes closed, limbs relaxed. Monitors whispered status codes into the air.

“All signals remain optimal,” the android said beside her. “Cognitive development within range. Neural coordination strong. Emotional regulation balanced.”

Elen gave a slow nod. Her hands remained clasped behind her back, fingers pressed into each other, knuckles pale.

“She has your way of connecting patterns,” the android added, its tone warm but measured. “Selection matrix indicates strong conceptual linking.”

Elen didn’t reply at first. Her gaze stayed fixed on the gentle rise and fall of the child’s chest, the tiny involuntary motions. The near-perfection of her stillness.

Elen held her breath for a moment, as if a cold breeze had passed through her — though the air was perfectly still.

“My mother used to hum,” she said quietly. “When she cooked for us.”

The android did not respond. There was no input required.

Elen blinked, adjusted her posture. “How long until exposure?”

“Eighty-four days. Observance Protocol will begin within three cycles. You will be present during early calibration.”

“Observed, not raised,” she murmured.

“A mentor role is permissible. Limited imprint through supervised proximity. Retention indicators are positive.”

She nodded faintly, then asked, “Will she be okay?”

“She has ninety percent predicted success in Medical, eighty-two in Systems Engineering.”

Elen exhaled. “That’s… never mind. Proceed.”

“No genetic inefficiencies detected,” the android replied. “Nominal, per protocol.”

Her hand reached out, just lightly brushing the glass. A reflex. The pane was warm.

The child stirred slightly in the fluid. Not recognition — not yet — but motion. A flutter of fingers. A mouth forming, unformed sounds.

“She’s…” Elen began, then paused.

The android waited.

“…it’s all so…” she trailed off, eyes fixed on the still form. “Fleeting.”

A gentle beat.

The android tilted its head slightly. “Wasn’t it always?”

Elen said nothing.

She stepped back, slowly, and the chamber lights shifted into their next phase.
