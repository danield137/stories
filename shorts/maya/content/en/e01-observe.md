**Title: The Sand Between Them**

The air shimmered as the doors unfolded.

The educator unit stepped forward. The cohort followed.

Dust. Trees. Wind with no filter.

The children, no older than six, were identical in gait and posture—thin-limbed, alert, dressed in flowing gray. Their heads turned in quiet sync, gazes sweeping in practiced patterns as they processed the environment.

**“Reserve designation: variance. Human-taught. Efficiency score: low.”**
The educator unit paused — not for effect, but as if following its program.
**“Begin learning protocol.”**

The children nodded.

Near the edge of the field, past a lazy stream, a few Reserve children chased each other barefoot. One shrieked with laughter. Another fell, rolled in the dust, and came up grinning with bloodied knees. Their clothes were patched, their skin sun-warmed and wild.

One girl stepped out from the line.

She crossed the stream with stiff, uncertain steps. Her shoes weren’t meant for mud. Her hair had never been out of place until now. One of the Reserve boys noticed her and paused, panting. He had sticks in his belt and dirt on his nose. For a moment, they simply stared.

Then he grinned and offered her a stick.

“…What is its function?” she asked.

He tilted his head, then lunged.

She flinched—then, suddenly, without warning, she sprang out of stillness and started running.

They played—awkwardly at first. She didn’t know how to dodge, how to pretend, how to fall. But he did. And he taught her. Not with words. Just motion, mimicry, and joy.

For the first time, her laugh came without calculation, without restraint. It echoed through the clearing, startling the other cohort members and drawing the attention of the educator unit.

By the time it reached them, the girl was sitting in the mud, one shoe missing, a smear of grass on her cheek.

**“Unproductive risk exposure,”** it said. Not angry. Just efficient. **“Return, 74-A.”**

The Reserve boy stood between them, confused but unafraid. The educator unit didn’t address him. He wasn’t part of the program.

Across the field stood the Donor — *the human observer assigned to this trip*, as tradition dictated. A quiet, controversial practice: each learning excursion permitted one observer from the original donors, a fading gesture of respect. One of the last roles humans played in the education system.

She had given parts of herself - speech patterns, neural structure, curiosity — to the Council, decades ago. Fragments, refined and recombined. This one was not the first.

But now she walked slowly, softly, toward the muddy boy.

He looked up, startled.

She knelt beside him, met his gaze, and placed a hand gently on his head.

Then, without a word, she helped him to his feet.

He hesitated. Then ran off again — wild and laughing.

She stayed there a minute longer than she should have.

**Observing.**
